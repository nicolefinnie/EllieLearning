# Introduction
A stand-alone Android app using `Tensorflow` that helps a baby to learn more about the new world.

# Getting started
- [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/install.html)
- Import the project on Android Studio `File->New->Project from Vision Control->GitHub` or `git clone` this repository and import this project to Android Studio. 
- Install missing dependencies in Android Studio, it's smart enough to walk you through the installation steps. e.g. you probablly need to install `CMake`, mark the checkbox `CMake` under `Tools > Android > SDK Manager`. For more details, see [Add C and C++ Code to Your Project](https://developer.android.com/studio/projects/add-native-code.html).
- DONE, just run the app on your smartphone!
